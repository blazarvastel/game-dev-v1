## Game Coding and Drinfeld Modules

This contains a SageMath script for implementing some useful functions connected to Drinfeld modules and skew polynomials. 

It also contains some sample DOCX files to be used to test some applications of skew polynomials to Gabidulin codes.

Includes supplementary "game gen" files for testing applications to coding theory and from which some experimental results were derived, and 
which may be used for further game code development.

Simply open a sagemath session and type:

load("drinfeld_trank.sage")

to load the script.

One can also import the game_gen_skew.py module and use the methods provided.
